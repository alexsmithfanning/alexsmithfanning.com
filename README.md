Source code of my personal website

## To the human grading my website

This was created with a framework called [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com), which makes it a lot easer to make a website look like mine does conforming to the Material Design Guidelines that Google has set for Android and Chrome OS. **I did not create this framework**, but the license does require that I give some sort of attribution.

Before you ask; no, this is nothing like WordPress, Weebly, WiX, or other drag and drop website creation tools. In my opinion, those shouldn't be allowed in any type of setting, but whatever.

Anyway, this isn't some kind of template. Although they *do have* templates that you can download and modify, it still isn't as limited as WordPress is. In fact, you can edit everything about it. But I created mine from scratch using the CSS and JavaScript they provide in the binaries and added my own stylesheet to fix a few bugs that I have found along the way.

I used [Atom by GitHub](https://atom.io) for about sixty percent of it, [Brackets by Adobe](https://brackets.io) for about thirty percent, and Geany for about ten percent due to how amazing the syntax highlighting is and how fast it runs on Linux.

### **WARNING!**

This website **does not work in Internet Explorer**. Not only does Internet Explorer not support ligatures (the way I got icon fonts on my navigation bar) but is also partly because I did it on purpose. **Internet Explorer is dead, stop using it for the sake of everybody**. There is no reason for you to be using it when there's Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox out there that conform to the HTML5 standards much better. Technological incompetence is no reason for twenty percent of people to still be using it. Don't be the twenty percent. Be the intelligent eighty percent.
