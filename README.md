## To the human grading my website

This was created with a framework called [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com), which makes it a lot easer to make a website look like mine does conforming to the Material Design Guidelines that Google has set for Android and Chrome OS. **I did not create this framework**, but the license does require that I give some sort of attribution.

Before you ask; no, this is nothing like WordPress, Weebly, WiX, or other drag and drop website creation tools. In my opinion, those shouldn't be allowed in any type of setting, but whatever.

Anyway, this isn't some kind of template. Although they *do have* templates that you can download and modify, it still isn't as limited as WordPress is. In fact, you can edit it everything about it. But I created mine from scratch using the CSS and JavaScript they provide in the binaries and added my own stylesheet to fix a few bugs that I have found along the way.
