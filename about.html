      <h2 class="header">Overview</h2>
      <p>I was born June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/k1z8zCdYzQD2" target="_blank">Gardner, Kansas</a> to my mom Kellie Smith and my father Timothy Fanning (hence the last name <i>Smith-Fanning</i>). I've been in Gardner all my life, and I hope to keep it that way. My father left before I was born and is now living somewhere in Arizona, so its just me, my mom, and my cat living together. While I was growing up I never really got to do much because we didn't really have a lot of money, but we were far from poor. In 2007 I went to Florida and got to have my first glimpse of the ocean and everything in it. From that point on I loved the ocean&#8212;and I still do. In 2010 my mom took me to Jamaica where I once again got to experice the ocean. That was the last time I got to travel, because in 2009 my grandmother died and due to some extenuating circumstances we had to move out. Since that point we have been living just below the poverty line, paycheck to paycheck.</p>
      <h2 class="header">School</h2>
      <h5 class="header">Elementary</h5>
      <p>I went to Sunflower Elementary for my first two years of school where I met my best friend Brandon. After first grade, I was transfered to Gardner Elementary for another two years, and my best friend followed. In fourth grade, I was sent to Moonlight Elementary for my final year of elementary school. This year for me was arguably one of the worst years I have ever had in my eleven years of going to school; mostly due to the fact that my teacher used methods of doing things that I have never seen before, which she then forced upon me.</p>
      <h5 class="header">Junior high</h5>
      <p>Junior high was a fairly eventful four years. I went to Wheatridge Middle School (which was previously our town's high school) where me and my friend slowly drifted apart because he moved out into the country. I was pretty much alone all of my sixth grade year, so I began looking for other friends. Which was a fairly unsuccessful journey, as I stayed alone until my seventh grade year when I met David. He was a fellow nerd that is into much the same things I am, so we instantly became pretty good friends. During this time, I was also in my time of defiance&#8212;I never did my homework and I even threw a rock into some abandoned house's window. In eighth grade I started to open up to people and actually socialize with them, so I made quite a few more friends in that one year.</p>
      <h5 class="header">High school</h5>
      <p>High school is very much different from anything else I've experienced in my life. Everybody seems to be willing to sell their internal organs for a pack of gum, most students are complete assholes, and the lunch is worse than I could've ever imagined. Otherwise, it isn't too bad.</p>
