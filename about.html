            <h4>About my home town</h4>
            <p>Gardner is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 19,123.</p>
              <h5>History</h5>
<p>Gardner was founded where the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon/California Trails divided. The Santa Fe Trail sent travelers southwest through Sante Fe and Albuquerque toward Los Angeles and San Diego. The Oregon/California Trails bore west for a few miles before turning north toward the Kansas River valley, followed the Big Blue River into present-day Nebraska, followed the Platte River west, and ultimately split in present-day Wyoming, Idaho or Utah.</p>

<p>Gardner was founded as a Free-Stater settlement in 1857. Settled primarily by emigrants from Massachusetts, it may have been named for Henry Gardner, then governor of Massachusetts. Four years after its establishment, it became the first community in Johnson County — and perhaps the first in the state — to experience an attack by Confederate forces.</p>

<p>The first post office in Gardner was established in 1858.</p>
              <h5>Government</h5>
              <p>The mayor of Gardner is Chris Morrow, who was sworn in on April 15, 2013. The city council is made up of five at-large members. It currently has three elected members, Council President Kristina Harrison, Council Vice President Larry Fotovich, Steve Shute. In January 2012 Heath Freeman was appointed by Mayor Dave Drovetta to fill a council seat vacated by Brian Broxterman. In May 2013 Tory Roberts was appointed by Mayor Chris Morrow to fill the council seat vacated by Morrow due to his election to mayor.</p>
              <h5>Education</h5>
              <p>Gardner is part of the USD 231 school district. Located in Gardner are five out of the six elementary schools (Edgerton Elementary is the only school in the district not located in Gardner). These include Gardner Elementary, Sunflower Elementary, Madison Elementary, Nike Elementary, Grand Star Elementary, and Moonlight Elementary. The district also has three middle schools, Wheatridge, Trail Ridge, and Pioneer Ridge, and one high school (Gardner-Edgerton High School) all located in Gardner. The school district is building a new elementary school that will be open during the 2013-2014 school year.</p>

      <h2 class="header">Overview</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
          <p>I was born June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in <a class="modal-trigger" href="#hometown">Gardner, Kansas</a> to my mom Kellie Smith and my father Timothy Fanning (hence the last name <i>Smith-Fanning</i>). I've been in Gardner all
            my life, and I hope to keep it that way. My father left before I was born and is now living somewhere in Arizona, so its just me, my mom, and my cat living together. While I was growing up I never really got to do much because we didn't really
            have a lot of money, but we were far from poor. In 2007 I went to Florida and got to have my first glimpse of the ocean and everything in it. From that point on I loved the ocean&#8212;and I still do. In 2010 my mom took me to Jamaica where
            I once again got to experice the ocean. That was the last time I got to travel, because in 2009 my grandmother died and due to some extenuating circumstances we had to move out. Since that point we have been living just below the poverty line,
            paycheck to paycheck.

      <h2 class="header">School</h2>
      <h5 class="header">Elementary</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
          <p>I went to Sunflower Elementary for my first two years of school where I met my best friend Brandon. After first grade, I was transfered to Gardner Elementary for another two years, and my best friend followed. In fourth grade, I was sent to
            Moonlight Elementary for my final year of elementary school. This year for me was arguably one of the worst years I have ever had in my eleven years of going to school; mostly due to the fact that my teacher used methods of doing things that
            I have never seen before, which she then forced upon me.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h5 class="header">Junior high</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
          <p>Junior high was a fairly eventful four years. I went to Wheatridge Middle School (which was previously our town's high school) where me and my friend slowly drifted apart because he moved out into the country. I was pretty much alone all of
            my sixth grade year, so I began looking for other friends. Which was a fairly unsuccessful journey, as I stayed alone until my seventh grade year when I met David. He was a fellow nerd that is into much the same things I am, so we instantly
            became pretty good friends. During this time, I was also in my time of defiance&#8212;I never did my homework and I even threw a rock into some abandoned house's window. In eighth grade I started to open up to people and actually socialize
            with them, so I made quite a few more friends in that one year.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h5 class="header">High school</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
          <p>High school is very much different from anything else I've experienced in my life. Everybody seems to be willing to sell their internal organs for a pack of gum, most students are complete assholes, and the lunch is worse than I could've ever
            imagined. Otherwise, it isn't too bad. Although sometimes I wonder if we're all doomed already.</p>
